Welcome to PHPUnuhi - An easy tool to work with translation files!

## Installation

PHPUnuhi is based on PHP. So you need to have PHP installed.

### PHAR File

PHPUnuhi is available as `phar` file.
Just download the ZIP file, extract it and you are ready to go.

```
curl -O https:// 
unzip -o phpunuhi.zip
rm -f phpunuhi.zip
```

### Composer

You can also use PHPUnuhi with Composer. Just install it with this script.

```
composer require boxblinkracer/phpunuhi
```

You can then run it with this command

```
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi ...
```

## Configuration

The whole configuration is done using a XML file.
You can create different translation suites with different files and settings.

Configure a **translation** node for every scope of translation.
This scope can then contain multiple files that need to match and only vary in their content.

```xml

<phpunuhi>
    <translations>
        <translation name="Storefront Translations">
            <file>./snippets/de.json</file>
            <file>./snippets/en.json</file>
        </translation>
    </translations>
</phpunuhi>
```

## Validate Command

You can then start the validation of your translation files by running this command.

```bash 
php bin/phpunuhi validate --configuration=./phpunuhi.xml
```

## Export Command

You can easily export your translations into a CSV file that can be passed on to an external translator or company.
Every row will contain the translation key, and every column will be a different translation.

```bash 
php bin/phpunuhi export --configuration=./phpunuhi.xml
```
