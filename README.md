Welcome to PHPUnuhi - The easy framework to validate and manage translation files!

Unuhi? This is Hawaiian for "translate" or "translation".
Now that you know this, let's get started!

## 1. Basic Concept

This is a framework that helps you to **validate and maintain translation files**.
At the moment it only supports JSON based files.

Although it's not dependent on a specific platform, you can use it perfectly with Shopware 6 and other platforms.

For example, Shopware 6 has snippets based on JSON files.
If you develop plugins for this platform, you can build translation sets in PHPUnuhi that contain all your files for the individual languages, like EN, DE, NL, and whatever you support.
PHPUnuhi helps you to make sure you didn't forget any translations, screwed up structures across your language files and even
helps you to export and import your translations.

One of the benefits is, that this framework does not require anything else than your translation files.
This makes it a perfect fit for your CI/CD pipelines.

## 2. Installation

You can also use PHPUnuhi with Composer. Just install it with this script.

```
composer require boxblinkracer/phpunuhi
```

You can then run it with this command, once you have a configuration.

```
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi validate
```

## 3. Configuration

The whole configuration is done using XML.
You can create different **translation sets** with different files and settings.

Configure a **translation set** for every bundle (scope) of your translations.
Such a set can then contain multiple files with your individual language and locale values.

Create a new **phpunuhi.xml** file (or rename it to something else).

```xml

<phpunuhi>
    <translations>

        <set name="Storefront">
            <file locale="de">./snippets/storefront/de.json</file>
            <file locale="en">./snippets/storefront/en.json</file>
        </set>

        <set name="Admin" format="json">
            <file locale="de">./snippets/admin/de.json</file>
            <file locale="en">./snippets/admin/en.json</file>
        </set>

    </translations>
</phpunuhi>
```

* Every set can have its own storage format (default is JSON).
* Every translation file can have its own locale (it's used in a few spots - experimental at the moment).

## 4. Validate Command

Start the validation of your translation files by running this command:

```bash 
# loads configuration phpunuhi.xml as default
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi validate 

# provide custom configuration
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi validate --configuration=./translations.xml
```

### 5. Validations

#### 5.1 Invalid structure

The command will check if all files of a translation set have the **same structure**.
If not, you might have forgotten something ;)

#### 5.2 Missing translations

If missing translations (**empty values**) are found, the validation process will fail.
This helps against forgetting certain translations in any of your files.

## 6. Export Command

You can export your translations **into a CSV file**, a HTML WebEdit spreadsheet, or other supported exchange formats.
These files can then be passed on to an external translator or company.

Every row will contain the translation key, and every column in that row will be a different translation (in case of CSV files).

```bash 
# default export in default exchange format CSV
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi export 

# default export in specific exchange format
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi export ... --format=html

# provide custom export folder
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi export ... --dir=./exports

# only export single set "storefront"
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi export ... --set="storefront"
```

> For more options and arguments of the formats please see the appendix below!

## 7. Import Command

You can import your translations **from a CSV file** or other supported exchange formats.
This will automatically update the storage files (JSON, ...) that have been assigned to the imported translation set.

> It's recommended to use version control to verify changes, before approving them.

```bash 
# import from default format CSV
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi import --set=storefront --file=storefront.csv

# import with other exchange format
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi import ... --format=html

# intent of 4 spaces in saved JSON
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi import ... --json-intent=4

# sort JSON based files alphabetically
php vendor/bin/phpunuhi import ... --json-sort
```

> For more options and arguments of the formats please see the appendix below!

## 8. Use Cases

Here are a few use cases and ideas to get you started.

### 8.1 Validation in CI pipeline

One of the typical things you want to make sure is, that your plugin/software doesn't miss any
required translations.

This can be done directly within your CI pipeline. Just install your dependencies and run the validation command.
The exit value of this command will automatically stop your pipeline if an error is detected.

### 8.2 Working with external translation agencies

External translation agencies often require CSV exports.
You can easily generate and export a CSV file for your partner agencies.

Once they have adjusted their translation, they can send you the file back and you simply
import it again with the import command.

### 8.3 Live WebEdit with HTML

If you have a test or staging system, you can even go one step further.
Just imagine setting up a cronjob that runs after a deployment, or as scheduled job.
This cronjob could trigger the HTML export of PHPUnuhi with an output directory to a folder that is available within your DocRoot.
That HTML file might then be exposed with something like this **https://stage.my-shop.com/snippets**.

Everyone who wants to either see all translations, or even modify them, can easily do this in their browser.
And because you use a cronjob to generate the file, it's always automatically updated.

## 9 Appendix

### 9.1 Storage Formats

Storage formats define how your translations are stored.
Every format has its own loading and saving implementation.

The following formats are currently supported.

#### 9.1.1 JSON

* Format: "json"
* Arguments:
    * Import Command
        * --json-sort
        * --json-intent

The JSON format means that your files are stored in separate JSON files.
Every locale has its own JSON file.
The JSON structure across all files of a set should match.

### 9.2 Exchange Formats

Exchange formats define how you export and import translation data.
The main purpose is to send it out to a translation company or just someone else,
and be able to import it back into your system again.

The following formats are currently supported.

#### 9.2.1 CSV

* Format: "csv"
* Arguments:
    * Export Command
        * --csv-delimiter
    * Import Command
        * --csv-delimiter

The CSV format is a well known and solid format for interoperability.
You can open CSV files with Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers as well as simple text editors or more.
The only downside with Excel and Numbers is, that they might force you to save the updated file in their own formats (just pay attention to this).

The benefit is that you can simply open all translation in a spreadsheet.
Every translation key has its own row, and all locale-values have their own column in that row.

</p>

#### 9.2.2 HTML / WebEdit

* Format: "html"

The HTML export helps you to export all translations into a single HTML file.
You can then open this file in your browser and immediately start to edit your translations.

Once finished, just slick on "save translations". This will download a **html.txt** file that
you can import again into your system with the format **html** in PHPUnuhi.
